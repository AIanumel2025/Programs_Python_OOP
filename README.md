### A repository of all python programs created, focusing on OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, methods, and data structuring. Created during self-study for real-world apps like vehicle trackers, pet simulations and more.
### Introduction
In this repository, I write code for several programs such as vehicle trackers, A family tree, a dog pound and more. I attempt to explain the code, identifying the pitfalls faced in its execution and debugging.
