### A repository of all python programs created, focusing on OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, methods, and data structuring. Created during self-study for real-world apps like vehicle trackers, pet simulations and more.
### Introduction
***In this repository, I write code for several programs such as vehicle trackers, A family tree, a dog pound and more. I attempt to explain the code, identifying the pitfalls faced in its execution and debugging. Share your opinion, pointing out the potential issues, or even other approaches to make it run more efficiently***
